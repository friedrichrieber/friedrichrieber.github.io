This is my first Blog Post. Testing out Jekylls Static Site Builder.

My Goal with this Blog is to document my personal Projects, which are listed on my GitHub Account.

In addition to that some tipps and tricks about multiple Topics and other Projects which are not big enough to get their own repository.
