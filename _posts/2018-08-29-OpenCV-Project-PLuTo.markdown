# General 

PLuTO (Puck Lokalisierung und Tracking mit OpenCv) German for "Puck Localisation and Tracking with OpenCV" is a Software designed for Physik Students.

At TU Berlin Physik Students try to simulate Particels in a gas with hockey like pucks on a air table.

This software tries to help the Students with tracking the pucks.

# Development 

## General 

The software was developed during the "Mathesis Labor" Course from the Technical University Berlin in a Group of about 15 people at the start and was finished, like a lot of group projects, by 5 remaining Students. This high drop out Rate can be explained by the voluntary status of the lab. Mathesis is one of many labs in the "MINTgr√ºn Orientierungsstudium" which is a 2 Semester orientation study direction at the Technical University of Berlin. 

## Goals

The Goals for this Software were: 

- learning python
- learning OpenCV (Open Computer Vision Library)
- learning Tkinter (Gui Library)

- producing a tool which can track pucks 
- learning a little bit machine learning for detection 
- learning to work in a group

## Final Results

At the end of this group project there were only a fraction of the persons still working on it but we still managed to get something working with a somewhat nice looking GUI put together. 

## Personal conclusion

In addition to python, OpenCV, bash scripting, azure server handling and git on the technical site i learned a lot of how working in a bigger group works and how hard it is to finish a project and how important communication is. Overall i would say the Mathesis Lab was a total succes although our finished Product is not the thing we dreamed of.
# Usage 

The software has yet to be used, the idea of physics student using this software was hypothetical but could have become a reality.
